# Princeton-AI4ALL-2022
The project my team worked on during the Princeton AI4ALL program in June 2022


We were given the Amazon Rainforest Satellite Image Dataset from Kaggle(unfortunately we couldn't include the actual data), and were tasked with developing some form of research presentation using it. By combining it with the EuroVision Satellite Dataset, we created a program tasked with comparing domain adaptation performance between the two distributions of data.

Some Key Parts of the Project:
1. Data Imbalance in the Amazon Dataset
2. Adapting the Eurovision Dataset 
3. Saving and Plotting Various Metrics
